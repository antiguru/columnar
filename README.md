# Columnar Encoding/Decoding #

This is a pretty simple start to columnar encoding and decoding in Rust. For the moment it just works on uints, pairs, vectors, and combinations thereof. Some extensions are pretty obvious (to other base types, tuples of other arities), but I'll need to get smarter to handle enumerations, user defined structs, and such.
